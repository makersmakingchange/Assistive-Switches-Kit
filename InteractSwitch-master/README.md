Edit: This quick fix to the design incorporates the following:
- Increases the screw hole size in the ButtonCapHolder to accept both M2.5 screws as well as #4 3/8" screws.
- Lines up the holes in the base with the holes in the ButtonCapHolder.
- Deepens the countersink in the Base for the screws.
- Removes the need for supports on the Base piece.
- Decreases the required sanding by tapering the tabs on the ButtonCapHolder.

Note: Only the generic ButtonBase has been updated, not the ButtonBase_Spade.
